Credits
-------
This package is very much inspired by these excellent packages that already exist for the Ruby/Rails ecosystem.

* [Searchkick](https://github.com/ankane/searchkick)
* [Elasticsearch Rails](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-rails)

A lot of their ideas have been reused to work within a PHP/Laravel environment.
